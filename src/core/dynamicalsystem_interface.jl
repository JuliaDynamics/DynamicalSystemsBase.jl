    DynamicalSystem

`DynamicalSystem` is an abstract supertype encompassing all concrete implementations
of what counts as a "dynamical system" in the DynamicalSystems.jl library.

**_All concrete implementations of `DynamicalSystem`
can be iteratively evolved in time via the [`step!`](@ref) function._**
Hence, most library functions that evolve the system
will mutate its current state and/or parameters. See the documentation online
for implications this has on for parallelization.

`DynamicalSystem` is further separated into two abstract types:
`ContinuousTimeDynamicalSystem, DiscreteTimeDynamicalSystem`.
The simplest and most common concrete implementations of a `DynamicalSystem`
are [`DeterministicIteratedMap`](@ref) or [`CoupledODEs`](@ref).

## Description

!!! note
    The documentation of `DynamicalSystem` follows chapter 1 of
    [Nonlinear Dynamics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-91032-7),
    Datseris & Parlitz, Springer 2022.

A `ds::DynamicalSystem` **_representes a flow Φ in a state space_**.
It mainly encapsulates three things:

1. A state, typically referred to as `u`, with initial value `u0`.
   The space that `u` occupies is the state space of `ds`
   and the length of `u` is the dimension of `ds` (and of the state space).
2. A dynamic rule, typically referred to as `f`, that dictates how the state
   evolves/changes with time when calling the [`step!`](@ref) function.
   `f` is a standard Julia function, see below.
3. A parameter container `p` that parameterizes `f`. `p` can be anything,
   but in general it is recommended to be a type-stable mutable container.

In sort, any set of quantities that change in time can be considered a dynamical system,
however the concrete subtypes of `DynamicalSystem` are much more specific in their scope.
Concrete subtypes typically also contain more information than the above 3 items.

In this scope dynamical systems have a known dynamic rule `f` defined as a
standard Julia function. _Observed_ or _measured_ data from a dynamical system
are represented using `StateSpaceSet` and are finite.
Such data are obtained from the [`trajectory`](@ref) function or
from an experimental measurement of a dynamical system with an unknown dynamic rule.

## Construction instructions on `f` and `u`

Most of the concrete implementations of `DynamicalSystem`, with the exception of
[`ArbitrarySteppable`](@ref), have two ways of implementing the dynamic rule `f`,
and as a consequence the type of the state `u`. The distinction is done on whether
`f` is defined as an in-place (iip) function or out-of-place (oop) function.

* **oop** : `f` **must** be in the form `f(u, p, t) -> out`
    which means that given a state `u::SVector{<:Real}` and some parameter container
    `p` it returns the output of `f` as an `SVector{<:Real}` (static vector).
* **iip** : `f` **must** be in the form `f!(out, u, p, t)`
    which means that given a state `u::AbstractArray{<:Real}` and some parameter container `p`,
    it writes in-place the output of `f` in `out::AbstractArray{<:Real}`.
    The function **must** return `nothing` as a final statement.

`t` stands for current time in both cases.
**iip** is suggested for systems with high dimension and **oop** for small.
The break-even point is between 10 to 100 dimensions but should be benchmarked
on a case-by-case basis as it depends on the complexity of `f`.

!!! note "Autonomous vs non-autonomous systems"
    Whether the dynamical system is autonomous (`f` doesn't depend on time) or not, it is
    still necessary to include `t` as an argument to `f`. Some algorithms utilize this
    information, some do not, but we prefer to keep a consistent interface either way.
    You can also convert any system to autonomous by making time an additional variable.
    If the system is non-autonomous, its _effective dimensionality_ is `dimension(ds)+1`.

## API

The API that the interface of `DynamicalSystem` employs is
the functions listed below. Once a concrete instance of a subtype of `DynamicalSystem` is
obtained, it can quieried or altered with the following functions.

The main use of a concrete dynamical system instance is to provide it to downstream
functions such as `lyapunovspectrum` from ChaosTools.jl or `basins_of_attraction`
from Attractors.jl. A typical user will likely not utilize directly the following API,
unless when developing new algorithm implementations that use dynamical systems.

### API - information

- `ds(t)` with `ds` an instance of `DynamicalSystem`: return the state of `ds` at time `t`.
  For continuous time systems this interpolates and extrapolates,
  while for discrete time systems it only works if `t` is the current time.
